*** The essence of OOP is desiging and extending your own data types.
fundamental types (integers and floating-point numbers) and compound types (arrays,strings, pointers and structures)

2 simple variables
three fundamental properties: where, value, type
underscore _ , __fools reserved, strident
nMyWeight a prefix that describes the variable's type
presage, positive and negative value
The funfamental unit of computer memory is the bit.
Think of a bit as an electronic switch that you can set to either off or on.
kilobyte, megabyte
short is short for short int
sizeof operator
symbolic constants the preprocessor way
#define INT_MAX 32767  C relic
look through the program for instance of INT_MAX and replace each occurrence with 32767.
const keyword
initialization combines assignment with declaration
decimal, hex, octal
cout << oct;
cout << 45;
suffix 123L
In practice, many systems support fewer than 128 kinds of characters, so a single byte can represent the whole range.
cin and cout are guided by the type of variable.
*** C++ uses single quotation marks for a character and double quotation marks for a string.
cout << 'q'; cout.put('q');
escape sequence 转义字符 '\n'
*** C++ interprets nonzero values as true and zeros values as false.
bool is_ready = true;

3 floating-point type
conspiracy
moving decimal point is the origin of the term "floating-point."
By default, floating-point type constants are type double.
scaling factor, operands, modulus 19 % 5 = 4

*** order of operation: operator precedence and associativity

4 type conversions
profusion
(1) conversion on initialization and assignment
the value is converted to the type of the receiving variable.
loss of precision, out of range
C++ uses truncation (discarding the fractional part) and not rounding (finding the closest integer value) when converting floating-point value to integer types.
*** short fowl = chickens + ducks;
