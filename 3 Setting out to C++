1 outline
(1) creating a C++ program
(2) the general format for a c++ program
(3) the #include directive
(4) the main() function
(5) using the cout object for output
(6) comments
(7) endl
(8) declaring and using variables
(9) cin input
(10) functions

2 C++ initiation
facility
C++ is case sensitive; that is,it discriminates between uppercase characters and lowercase characters.
stripped of the trimmings
the function header describes the interface between a function and the function that calls it
parentheses, phase
Using void in the parentheses is an explicit way of saying that the function takes no arguments.
concession, encounter

3 C++ comments
double slash //
C++ also recognizes C comments, which are enclosed between /* and */ symbols.
try sticking to the C++ style

4 The c++ preprocessor and iostream file
#include <iostream>
This directive causes the preprocessor to add the contents of the iostream file to your program.
In essence, replace
composite file
dropping the h extension and prefixing the filename with a c
iostream.h, math.h, iostream, cmath

use iostream instead of iostream.h, you should use the following namespace directive 
in h-free header files, 

5 cout
insertion operator << bitwise left-shift operator  operator overloading
>> extraction operator
*** endl is a special C++ notation that represents the importment concept of beginning a new line
cause the screen cursor to move to the beginning of the next line
\n, endl   One difference is that endl guarantees the output will be flushed
cout << carrots
first, cout replace carrots with its value. second, it translates the proper output character

6 variable
carrots is called a variable because you can change its value
The C++ style for declaring variables is to declare a variable as close to its first use as possible
remarkable, internally
25 stored as a binary value rather than store each digit separately
cout ostream class

7 function
C++ function come in two varieties: those with return values and those without them
The library files contain the compiled code for the function, whereas the header files contain the proyotypes.

explicit, implicit
5 to the eighth power
C++ does not allow you to embed one function definition inside another.
return 0 provide the return value and terminate the function.
main()'s return value to the operating system
main is not a keyword.
C++ programmers are blessed (or cursed) with myriad options when naming functions
convention, hallmark

#include <iostream> causes the contents of the iostream file to be substituted for this directive before final compilation.
