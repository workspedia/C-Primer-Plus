C++ provides many new function features that separate C++ from its C heritage.
The new features include inline functions, by reference variable passing, default argument values, function overloading and template functions.

2 C++ inline function
inline functions are a c++ enhancement designed to speed up programs.
difference between noraml fun and inline function: how the C++ compiler incorporates them into a program.
*** The final product of the compilation process is an executable program, which consists of a set of machine language instructions.
*** Normal function calls involve having a program jump to another address (the function address) and then jump back when the fun terninates.
memory penalty:
the compiler replace the function call with the corresponding function code.

*** recursion is not allowed or indeed possible for inline functions.
*** Inline versus macros
The inline facility is an addition to C++. C uses the preprocessor #define statement to provide macros, which are crude implementations of inline code.
#define SQUARE(X) X*X
this works not by passing arguments but through text substitution.
