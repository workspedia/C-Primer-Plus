(1) for loop
(2) expressions and statements
(3) ++ and --
(4) relational operator
(5) while loop
(6) typedef
(7) do while loop
(8) nestd loops and two-dimensional arrays

2 for loop
loop initialization, loop test, loop update 
i++ complete a cycle of loop
stretch, indent, peculiar
you can declare a variable in the initialization area of for loop.
factorial,concise
const value in an array, changing the step size

*** Before the bool type was introduced, relational expressions evaluated to 1 if true and 0 if false
int a = 0;
cout << boolalpha; // cout.setf(ios_base::boolalpha);
cout << (a > 1) << endl << (a <2);
output:
false
true
*** normally, cout converts bool value to int before displaying them

when the very act of evaluating an expression changes the value of data in memory ,we say the evaluation has a side effect.
sequence point
++i is more efficient
++*pt, *++pt
sneak, grant, relevant, pitfall

Type aliases
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define kai int   
typedef char bell;
int main() {
	kai a = 0;
	bell b = 't';
	cout << boolalpha;
	cout << (a > 1) << endl << b;
	return 0;
}

3 loops and text input
*** an important task assigned to loop is reading text character-by-character from a file or from the keyboard

	int a;
	do
	{
		cin >> a;
	} while (a !=7);
	cout << "Yes, 7 is my favourite number."<< endl;
  
  *** when reading type char values, just as when reading other basic types, cin skips over spaces and newline characters.
  the spaces in the input are not echoed, so they are not counted.
  
  int a = 0;
	char ch;
	cin >> ch;
	while (ch != '#')
	{
		cout << ch;
		cin >> ch;
		++a;
	}
	cout << endl << a << endl;
	return 0;

 *** the input to cin is buffered.
 *** the character you type do not get sent to the program until you press Enter.
 
	int a = 0;
	char ch;
	cin.get(ch);
	while (ch != '#')
	{
		cout << ch;
		cin.get(ch);
		++a;
	}
	cout << endl << a << endl;
	return 0;
  
  cin.get(ch) includes the spaces. // cin.get() function declares the argument as a reference, it alters the value of ch
  
 end-of-file (EOF), simulate the EOF condition from the keyboard.
