(1) for loop
(2) expressions and statements
(3) ++ and --
(4) relational operator
(5) while loop
(6) typedef
(7) do while loop
(8) nestd loops and two-dimensional arrays

2 for loop
loop initialization, loop test, loop update 
i++ complete a cycle of loop
stretch, indent, peculiar
you can declare a variable in the initialization area of for loop.
factorial,concise
const value in an array, changing the step size

*** Before the bool type was introduced, relational expressions evaluated to 1 if true and 0 if false
int a = 0;
cout << boolalpha; // cout.setf(ios_base::boolalpha);
cout << (a > 1) << endl << (a <2);
output:
false
true
*** normally, cout converts bool value to int before displaying them

when the very act of evaluating an expression changes the value of data in memory ,we say the evaluation has a side effect.
sequence point
++i is more efficient
++*pt, *++pt
sneak, grant, relevant, pitfall
