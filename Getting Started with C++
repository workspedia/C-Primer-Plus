(1) history & philosophy
(2) procedural versus object-oriented programming
(3) add object-oriented concepts to C
(4) add generic programming concepts to C
(5) standards
(6) creating a program

2 introduction
C ancestry brings to C++  efficient, compact, fast, portable
Object-oriented heritage   a fresh programming methodology, designed to cope with the escalating complexity
template features bring yet   genetric programming
triple heritage is both a blessing and a bane

be poised to learn C++, mind-stretching efforts, resilient, nook, cranny

3 origins
 evolve, involve, revolve
 mainframe computer, spawn, discipline, address hardware matters
 These gifts helped make C the dominant programming language in the 1980s.
 Meanwhile, the 1980s witnessed the growth of a new programming paradigm: OOP
 
 4 The C Language
 assembly language
 graft
 computer languages deal with two concepts, data and algorithms
 C is a procedual language, which means it emphasizes the algorithm side of programmming.
 A program prescribes a set of procedures for the computer to follow
 structured programming, C include features to facilitate this approach
 Top-down design
 
 5 The C++ shift: OOP
 OOP emphasizes the data
 property rotate
 The process of going from a lower level of organization, such as classes, to a higher level, such as program designs, is called bottom-up 
 programming.
