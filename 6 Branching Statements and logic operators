2 if statement
Range Tests 
Note that each part of a range test should use the AND operator to join two complete relational expressions: 
if (age > 17 && age < 35)   // OK Don’t borrow from mathematics and use the following notation: 
// Don't do this! If you make this mistake, the compiler won’t catch it as an error because it is still valid C++ syntax.
if (17 < age < 35)          
The  < operator associates from left to right, so the previous expression means the following: 
if ( (17 < age) < 35) But 17 < age is either  true, or  1, or else  false, or  0. 
In either case, the expression  17 < age is less than  35, so the entire test is always  true!

the C++ logical OR and logicalAND operators have a lower precedence than relational operators.
This means that an expression such as this x > 5 && x < 10 is interpreted this way: (x > 5) && (x < 10) 
The ! operator,on the other hand,has a higher precedence than any of the relational or arithmetic operators.
The logical  AND operator has a higher precedence than the logical OR operator.Thus this expression: 
age > 30 && age < 45 || weight > 300 means the following: (age > 30 && age < 45) || weight > 300

3 cctype library of character functions
the isalpha(ch) function returns a nonzero value if  ch is a letter and a zero value otherwise. 
 the  ispunct(ch) function returns a  true value  only  if  ch is a punctuation character, such as a comma or period. 
(These functions have return type  int rather than  bool, but  the  usual  bool conversions allow you to treat them as type  bool.) 
Using these functions is more convenient than using the  AND and OR operators. 
if ((ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') || (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z'))

&& and    || or  ! not

4 the ?: operator
conditional operator ?: it is the only C++operator that requires three operands.
The general form looks like this:expression1?expression2:expression3
cout << (5 > 3 ? 10 : 9 )<< endl;

5 switch
On reaching a  switch statement, a program jumps to the line labeled with the value corresponding to the value of  integer-expression. 

The value integer-expression must be an expression that reduces to an integer value, each label must be an integer constant expression. 
Most often, labels are simple  int or char constants, such as  1 or 'q', or enumerators. 

If integer-expression doesn’t match any of the labels, the program jumps to the line labeled default.The  default label is optional. 
 
Execution does not automatically stop at the next case.
To make execution stop at the end of a particular group of statements, you must use the break statement.
This causes execution to jump to the statement following the  switch. 

	switch (age)
	{
		case 'a' :
			cout << "first";
			// break;
		case 'b' :
			cout << "second";
			break;
		default:
			break;
	}
  
6 simple file input/output
No matter what the destination data type, the input begins as character data, that is text data.
The cin object then has the responsibility of translating text to other types.

suppose you have the following sample line of input:
38.5 19.2

char ch;
cin >> ch; // In this case, the first character is the digit 3, and the character code (in binary) for this digit is stored in ch.

int n;
cin >> n; // In this case, cin reads up to the first non-digit character. That is, it reads 3 and 8, leaving the period as the next character in the input queue. 
	int first;
	int second;
	cin >> first;
	cin >> second;
	cout << first << endl;
	cout << second;
output:
38.5 19.2
38
0

double x;
cin >> double; // In this case, cin reads up to the first character that's not part of a floating-point number, leaving the space as the next character in the input queue.
	double first;
	double second;
	cin >> first;
	cin >> second;
	cout << first << endl;
	cout << second;
	return 0;
38.5 19.2
38.5
19.2

char word[50];
cin >> word; // In this case, cin reads up to the whitespace character.
char word[50];
cin.getline(word, 50); // In this case, cin reads up through the newline character.

On output, the opposite translations take place.

In text file, each byte stores a character code.
Not all files are text files. For example, databases and spreadsheets store numeric data in number forms, that is, in binary integer or binary floating-point form.

The ostream header file defines an ostream class class for handling output.
The iostream header file declares an ostream variable, or object, called cout.
